# Topics for the possible research about the molecular dynamics
## 1
working classical molecular dynamics - powered by enhanced sampling  
methods: 
- here we run first, normal MD using GROMACS,
- then we run the same simulations, enhanced with other techniques(we use particularly  
metadynamics and artificial intelligence - metadynamics models)
  
## 2 
Based in the previous project as well, but using quantum molecular
- here we run first, normal MD using GROMACS(quantum molecular dynamics),
- then we run the same simulations, enhanced with other techniques(we use particularly  
metadynamics and artificial intelligence - metadynamics models)

First task that I have 2 weeks to complete as a beginning in the journey.
	
## dr.Carasscoza
is working with Prof. Bla≈ºewicz and Prof. Szchaniuk

## Unfiltered notes from the meeting with dr. Carasscoza

What books or articles should I read about the topic
	-  Carascoza's
	-  [[Abscals_potential_model_for_the_study_of_ices]]
What software and applications should I use for that?
	- GROMACS
	- PLUMED
	- PackMol
waterbox with grommacs and forces that work on that
	- [[simulating oxygen-oxygen correlation function]]

**Waterbox in space with origin of life**
	My question is how to get the data for that? What should we experiment for to make sure that is the real environment and not something that is impossible or not real. Making simulation of not this world is useless.
model that space environment
moleulcar dynamics in gromacs




18.02.2025  - 2 weeks to get this done
2 models - TIP4ICE and TIP4P, 2 forces fields 
try to model a box with
FORCE FIELD
- 5500 water molecules 
- density of 0.93 mg/l . 
- temp 273k/200k/150k
	- temp 298K to compare to the research
- TIP4P and TIP4P Ice
PROTOCOLS how to do that
	random geometry with PackMol
	Energy minimization
	Energy equilibaration - find out what is better to do - MAKE A CONCLUSISON
	Do the sampling by myself 
	Model for 2 nanoseconds 
		total energy
	- root mean square for oxygen atoms
	- uration radius oxygen to oxygen - layers of oxygen wikipedia - statistical graph distance and frequency
	- interatomic interactions

#question how should I plan my research? any advice when to read the articles, books and etc.?
#decision What schedule would I follow, the organization for each day what to do and follow that guide.
