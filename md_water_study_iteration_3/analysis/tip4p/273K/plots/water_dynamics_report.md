## Water Structure and Dynamics Interpretation

The diffusion coefficient measures how quickly water molecules move through the system. A value close to the 
experimental reference (1.1×10⁻⁵ cm²/s at 273K) indicates the simulation correctly captures water dynamics.

Hydrogen bonding statistics reveal the structural network of water. With approximately 3.5-4 hydrogen 
bonds per molecule in liquid water, the hydrogen bond structure is fundamental to water's unique properties.

The hydrogen bond lifetime is typically around 1-2 ps, highlighting the dynamic nature of the hydrogen 
bond network in liquid water, with bonds constantly breaking and reforming.

## Conclusions

This analysis provides insight into how well the simulation reproduces the correct behavior of water
at the simulated temperature. Significant deviations in diffusion coefficient may indicate issues with:
- Simulation parameters (timestep, cutoffs)
- Water model parameterization
- Equilibration issues
- Temperature or pressure control problems

Similarly, hydrogen bond statistics that differ substantially from expected values can indicate structural
problems with the water model or simulation conditions.
