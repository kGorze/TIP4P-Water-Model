# PackMol input file for generating water box
# Box with 5500 water molecules with careful initial placement to avoid bad contacts

tolerance 3.0
filetype pdb

# Initial placement in a larger box to avoid bad contacts
# Target density is 0.93 g/cmÂ³, but start with larger box for better minimization
# Final box will compress during NPT equilibration to reach the target density
