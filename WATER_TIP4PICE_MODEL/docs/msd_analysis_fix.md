# MSD Analysis Fix Documentation

## Issue

The workflow for the TIP4P water model molecular dynamics simulation was successfully completed up to the analysis phase. During the analysis, the MSD (Mean Square Displacement) calculation failed with the following error:

```
Error in user input:
Too few selections provided
```

## Root Cause

The `gmx msd` command requires a `-sel` parameter to specify which atoms to track for the diffusion coefficient calculation. In the original workflow script (`run_workflow.sh`), this selection parameter was missing:

```bash
# Original problematic command
gmx msd -f md.xtc -s md.tpr -o "${ANALYSIS_DIR}/msd.xvg" -beginfit 1000 -endfit 2000
```

Unlike the RDF calculation, which correctly used `-ref 'name OW' -sel 'name OW'` to specify oxygen atoms, the MSD command was missing the equivalent selection.

## Fix

A script (`fix_msd_analysis.sh`) was created to run only the failed MSD analysis step with the proper selection parameter:

```bash
# Fixed command
gmx msd -f md.xtc -s md.tpr -o "${ANALYSIS_DIR}/msd.xvg" -beginfit 1000 -endfit 2000 -sel "name OW"
```

The script successfully analyzed the mean square displacement of water oxygen atoms and calculated a diffusion coefficient of 4.4391 (±2.4539) × 10⁻⁵ cm²/s.

## Modifications for Future Runs

The main workflow script (`run_workflow.sh`) should be updated to include the `-sel` parameter in the MSD calculation as follows:

```bash
# Updated command for future runs
gmx msd -f md.xtc -s md.tpr -o "${ANALYSIS_DIR}/msd.xvg" -beginfit 1000 -endfit 2000 -sel "name OW"
```

## Recommendation

For future iterations of this workflow, consider implementing checkpoint files or status tracking to:

1. Record which steps have completed successfully
2. Allow restarting from specific steps in case of failures
3. Skip expensive simulation steps if they've already been completed successfully

This approach would save computational resources and time when troubleshooting specific analysis steps.
